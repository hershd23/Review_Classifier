# Review_Classifier

Here we take the IMDB review dataset and we try to classify the reviews into good or bad, based on whether the rating was greater that 7 or less than 4 (no in betweens).

## DATASET
You can get the dataset from the link :- https://s3.amazonaws.com/text-datasets/imdb_full.pkl
You can either save the .pkl file before running the code, however the steps to download the code have been provided in the Python Notebook itself.

## HOW TO RUN
Clone/Download the repository and simply run the code in the .ipynb file.
Check for the path variable if you have downloaded the data. I have used a directory named imdb for the same, feel free to change that.
